Dude, just walked out of Borderline and I’m like, what even was that? My mind feels like it got caught in a washing machine. The theater was buzzing, and someone had dropped a mountain’s worth of popcorn on the floor—crunchy accompaniment to the chaos on screen. My back hurts from those crammed seats or maybe it’s just the existential crisis the   gave me?

Like, there were moments in Borderline where I felt like I was 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 an ad for soap, all slow-motion water and suds, y'know? But it was so epic, like they were washing away sins or something, but also, I might be reading too much into it. The protagonist—I'm still trying to unravel whatever was going on in his mind. One minute he's yelling atop a cliff, next he's whispering sweet nothings to a cat. Made me wanna 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just to pause and go through frame by frame. 

> There’s this scene where the skies turn purple, and everything went all psychedelic. Reminded me of that one time I tried to make a smoothie with all the fruits I could find—just a bizarre blend of everything, man. Also, I swear I heard one of the actors talking in reverse? Or maybe the popcorn mess was messing with my brainwaves.

And oh, the music! Like eels slithering right into your ears, hard to ignore but not sure if you liked it. Like, a saxophone fighting with a banshee. Then the dialogue kept jumping around like it was coded in a faulty loop—fitting, since life feels like a loop sometimes, huh? The twists, man, more like tangled spaghetti. At one point, I thought I was 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a high-stakes chess game between an owl and a psychic lobster. Insane and I wanna 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again just to catch more of… whatever that was.

There was a moment when my phone buzzed and I remembered you wanted me to, I don't know, recommend it or save you from it? Yeah, just go 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   yourself, see the wild ride.

Last thing, the closing scene—I think it was a metaphor, maybe?—left my brain cells doing yoga, stretching to make sense of it all. A woman just staring into an aquarium, breathing heavy like she was gonna drown, but she was totally fine?? What do we even do with that? Tell me if you figure it out, alright?

```cpp
int main() {
    int random thought = 27;
    std::cout << Is this even real life? << std::endl;
    return 42;
}
